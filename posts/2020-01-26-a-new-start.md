Well it's 2020, and with a new year I felt like it was about time for a new site. My last site was a quick little Jekyll thing thrown together just to get something new up. I hadn't put much time or effort into it _at all_ and it was really not doing a great job of representing me as a designer.

This new site is built completely with [Vue](https://vuejs.org), relying on Github for this blog, the gallery, and the project listing. The styles are mostly from scratch, with a slight reliance on [s-grid](http://stylusgrid.com) and [rupture](https://github.com/jescalan/rupture) for handling the grid and media queries.

Overall it's been a fun project. I have a blog, a gallery for my "art" and "photography", and a way to showcase my favorite projects. I also have **dark mode**, which I think is my favorite overall thing about this project. You can expect me to post all kinds of content here, from life updates, to tutorials, to project announcements.

Looking forward to many more posts.
